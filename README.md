# Astral
My first original game
I'm using C++ as the main language with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for the graphics

## kind of a sword-magic rpg

### characteristics:

- In this world, the year is divided in 8 months, which are dictated by the Moon cycle. The Moon has 7 different colors, and every month is named after one of them. Each Moon phase has a magical influence on every living being, donating its magic to the creatures that are born under its color (human or not) (in e.g. red Moon -> fire magic -> Crimson Month) (yes I'm going to do things with eclipses)

- The main character is born during a day of full Moon (where the magic infused in the newborn is the strongest), receiving a magic type based on the month (the month will picked randomly or chosen by the player, dunno), particularly strong but not exceptional among the strongests.

* this mean that every magic shoud have attack, defense and buff capabilities, these buffs may interest items or characters.

### characters:

- "Virgil": this man is Wind mage, a very (VERY) strong one, born in a fallen noble family, his mission is to reclaim and restore his family name, his virtues are honesty and dedication.

- Astral: a boy born under the eclipse, devoid of any magic power but with limitless possibilities, he will Interact a lot with the Magic Researcher.

* The Magic Reseacher is a very curious and dedicated magic scientist. He will kidnap Astral in order to use him as a human experiment, making him rebirth under each full Moon to acquire every magic element, aiming to entrust him the power of a star. All of this for scientific purpose, may Astral destroy the world or not, he doesn't care.

### setting / world:

- medieval steampunk, new tecnology is being developed (along with new weapons, magical and traditionals).

Things that will be accessible for many peoples are: 
- faster travel via train, boats and planes prototypes;
- increased living standards;
- improved agricolture;
- improved imformation share between nations and cities.

### design

- Mostly pixel arts of medium/large resolution, combined with a 2.5D Third person, the environment is based on exagonal prisms (in battle, maybe also in the overworld).

- Similar ot FFTA the battles take place in 3D battlefields, where positioning matters. Generally magic is long ranged and less powerful, melee weapons are small ranged but more powerfull.

- The environment is essential in combat. It can interact with the players in many different ways, via danger zones ( differences in height greater than x, lava, ice, throny plants), influencing magic casted by tha players, (in an icy peak ice walls will last forever, but in a volcano only one turn), and offering safe spots (zone protected by natural elements or rocks). 

* The players are also able to modify the environment, by creating magic walls to trap or drive enemy in specific zones, terraforming the ground itself (effect that will also affect the zones outside the battlefield) and creating traps.

* NG+ but the protagonis is Astral

* Final quest takes 8 months and needs a trigger to start (player level, and player interacting with NPCS)
