# Random ideas i get for the game

- Time mage
	- rewind time of ceartain cells, bringing back their status and coditions
	- rewind time of character, reverting buff, debuffs, damage and health, DEATH and LIFE

- mini natural disasters and weather, modifying the flow of battle for everyone (in the middle of the battle or always) (can be applied by players)
	- rain and snow -> temp down
	- sunny day -> temp raised
	- strong wind -> fighting the wind takes strenght, decreased movement speed for the area 
	- earthquake -> changes landscape

- the environment influence magic and vice versa
	- a volcano weaken ice magic
	- a snowland weaken fire magic
	- wind changes direction of wind magic
	- etc ...

- water phisics
	- if you terraform the area around a lake/river/sea it will move the water, epanding it or making islands
	- same wit LAVA

- splitting wind magic from electric magic

- story
	- player/npc interaction will create small but (hopefully) interconnected sories
	- npcs will remember your actions

- characters
	- a couple of twins, if you kill one the other wil swear to kill you, vice versa with saving
	- underground heroine infatuated with the illusion of justice
